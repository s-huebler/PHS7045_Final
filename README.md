# gmhs2

This package is built to implement the Gibbs-Metropolis-Hastings Hybrid
Algorithm for Bayesian meta-analysis of multi-trial odds ratios with a
normally distributed random effect.

-The hierarchical analysis uses modularized functions, data
pregeneration, and matrix opterations to increase efficiency.

-The bayesian analysis uses rcpp and rcpp armadillo to increase
efficiency.

This package was modeled off of the template by Patrick Muchmore.

## Installation

You can install the development version of gmhs2 from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) by cloning the repository and building the
package.

# Examples

This R package includes use for empirical and hierarchical bayesian meta
analysis of the logit model with normal random effects. Please see the
Bayesian Meta Analysis Vignette for a tutorial.
