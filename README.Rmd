This package is built to implement the Gibbs-Metropolis-Hastings Hybrid Algorithm for Bayesian meta-analysis of mult-trial odds ratios with a normally distributed random effect. 


-The hierarchical analysis uses modularized functions, data pregeneration, and matrix opterations to increase efficiency.

-The bayesian analysis uses rcpp and rcpp armadillo to increase efficiency.

This package was modeled off of the template by Patrick Muchmore.
